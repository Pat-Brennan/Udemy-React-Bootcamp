//* What is State?

//* Thinking about State
//? In any sufficiently advanced web application, the user interface has to be STATEFUL
//? Example: Logged in users are going to see a different screen than logged out users.
//? Example: Clicking "Edit profile" opens up a modal(pop-up) window
//? Example: Sections of a website can expand or collapse, for instance clicking "read more"

//! The State of the client interface(frontend) is NOT always directly tied to state on the SERVER(backend)

//* State changes
//? State is designed to constantly CHANGE in RESPONSE to EVENTS
//? Consider the game of chess... at any given point, the board is in a complex STATE.
//? Every move made in chess represents a very discrete STATE CHANGE.

//* What does state track?
//? There are two types of things state on the client/frontend keeps track of:
//? UI Logic, and Business Logic

//* UI Logic
//? The changing state of the interface i.e there is a modal(pop up) open because I am editing my profile.

//* Business Logic
//? The changing state of the data i.e In my inbox, messages are either read or unread, ->
//? This in turn affects how they display.

//* What is React State?
//? In React, State is an instance attribute on a component.
//? It's always an object, since you'll want to keep tract of several keys/values

POJO(Plain Old JavaScript Object)
{
  player: "BIG TONY"
  score: 666
}

//* Initial State
//? State should be intialized as soon as the component is created.
//? It is set in the CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION, and must be called state(i.e this.state = {...})

//* React Constructor Function 
//? If your component is STATELESS, you can omit the constructor function.
//? If you are building a component with State, you need a standard React Constructor.

//? Constructor accepts ONE argument, PROPS.
//? You must call "super(props):" at start of constructor, ->
//? This registers your class as a React component.

//? Inside the instance methods we refer to this.state, just like we did this.props.

//* Changing State
//! You should never directly change the state! i.e Do not use this.state = { ... } twice!

//* this.setState()
//? A Built-in React method of changing a components state.
//? Can be called in any instance method, EXCEPT THE CONSTRUCTOR!
//? Example: this.setState({ playerName: "Johnson", score: 0 })

//* What does setState do?
//? Takes an object describing the state changes
//? Patches state object with those changes, ->
//? but does not touch aspects of state that were not specified in setState().
//? i.e "If it aint broke, don't fix it!"

//* setState is Asynchronous! 
//? The component state will *eventually* update
//? React controls when the state will actually change, for performance reasons.
//? Components entirely re-render when their state changes.
