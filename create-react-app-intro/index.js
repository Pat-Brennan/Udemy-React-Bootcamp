//* Create-React-App
//? React is a front-end library - you don't need server-side stuff!
//? Technically, you can get react.js and react-dom.js from a CDN
//? Technically, you can transpile JSX in the browser at runtime.
//! But there's a better way!

//? Create-React-App is a utility script that:
//? - Creates a skeleton react project
//? - Sets it up so that JS files are fun through Babel automatically
//? - Lets us use super-modern JavaScript features/idioms
//? - Makes testing & deployment much easier
