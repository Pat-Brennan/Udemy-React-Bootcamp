//* Create-React-App
//? React is a front-end library - you don't need server-side stuff!
//? Technically, you can get react.js and react-dom.js from a CDN
//? Technically, you can transpile JSX in the browser at runtime.
//! But there's a better way!

//? Create-React-App is a utility script that:
//? - Creates a skeleton react project
//? - Sets it up so that JS files are fun through Babel automatically
//? - Lets us use super-modern JavaScript features/idioms
//? - Makes testing & deployment much easier

//* Webpack
//? CRA is built on top of "Webpack", a JS utility that:
//? - Eables module importing/exporting
//? -- Packages up all the CSS/images/JS into a single file for browser
//? -- Dramatically reduces # of HTTP requests for performance
//? - Hot Reloading: when you change a source file, automatically reloads
//? -- it tries to only reload relevant files
//? - Enables easy testing & deployment
